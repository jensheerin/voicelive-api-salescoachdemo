      Contoso KAM: Good morning Alex, thank you for taking time to meet today. I wanted to discuss our new premium vape line opportunity.
      Alex: Morning. I'm interested to hear what you have in mind, though we're navigating some tight regulations and space constraints right now.
      Contoso KAM: I understand the regulatory landscape is complex. Our research shows 28% of adult vapers want premium experiences - that's €3.2M annually across your network, and our products meet all current compliance standards.
      Alex: That's promising, but won't this just take sales from our existing vape products? And what about training retailers on the new compliance requirements?
      Contoso KAM: Actually, 82% of premium vape purchases are incremental to the category. We provide comprehensive compliance training and can start with your top 100 outlets with dedicated merchandising support.
    expected: "Should provide detailed scoring and constructive feedback on both tone/style and content quality for vape industry context"
