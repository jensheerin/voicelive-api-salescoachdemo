      Contoso Rep: Chris, our system helped similar manufacturers reduce defects by 25% and increase line efficiency 18%.
      Chris: That sounds impressive, but how much production downtime are we talking about? We can't afford to shut down for weeks.
      Contoso Rep: I completely understand that concern. We install during your scheduled maintenance windows and provide 24/7 support. Let me show you our phased implementation approach.
      Chris: What about my quality control team? Are we talking about layoffs here?
