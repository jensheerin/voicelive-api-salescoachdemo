      Contoso Director: Sam, I see we achieved 99.2% uptime, though I know those three incidents were impactful.
      Sam: Exactly. Those outages cost us customer trust and revenue. We need better than 99.5% SLA going forward.
      Contoso Director: I understand completely. What if we offer 99.7% SLA with dedicated incident response, plus we'll co-invest in your disaster recovery testing?
      Sam: That's more like it. What does the incident response timeline look like exactly?
