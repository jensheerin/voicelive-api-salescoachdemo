### How It Works

1. **Choose a Scenario** - Select from various industry-specific sales situations
2. **Start the Conversation** - Click the microphone to start your simulation
3. **Engage with AI** - The virtual customer responds realistically based on the scenario
4. **Receive Feedback** - Get instant analysis on your performance including:
   - Speaking tone and style
   - Content quality
   - Needs assessment
   - Value proposition delivery
   - Objection handling skills

## Getting Started

### Deploy to Azure

1. **Deploy to Azure**:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```
2. **Access your application**:
   The deployment will output the URL where your application is running.

### Local Development

This project includes a dev container for easy setup and a build script for  development.

1. **Use Dev Container** (Recommended)
   - Open in VS Code and select "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   - All dependencies and tools are pre-configured

2. **Fill in the .env file**
   - Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
   - Fill in your Azure AI Foundry and Speech service keys and endpoints (you can run `azd provision` to create these resources if you haven't already)

3. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   # Build the application
   ./scripts/build.sh

   # Start the server
   cd backend && python src/app.py
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to start training!
